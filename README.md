## ARM-thumb Bare-metal Assembly
A collection of bare-metal assembly code for the NXP LPC824 using the GNU compiler toolchain. 

### Motivation
As an instructor who has been teaching embedded systems programming over 25 years, I always started out with some assembly programming to give an insight into the inner workings of the particular microcontroller in use. As devices with an ARM core became widely available, I found it necessary to move into this realm. The code examples presented target the LPC824 by NXP, hence, are based on the <b>thumb</b> instruction set. Pseudo instructions are avoided for educational purposes. Examples were tested on the LPCXpresso824-MAX board by NXP.
